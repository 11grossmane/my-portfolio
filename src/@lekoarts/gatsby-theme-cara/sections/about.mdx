<!-- ## About

Hi, I'm Eric Grossman. I am a passionate, and hardworking developer looking for a team of like-minded individuals. For the past few years, I have taught science at an outdoor school in Santa, Cruz California. My favorite part of the job was discovering new ways to deal with the challenge of an unpredictable setting. For this reason, I began searching for a career that would provide these kinds of challenges on a regular basis. My journey led me to begin exploring the world of coding, and before long I fell in love with the way it allowed me to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller parts. After graduating from Fullstack Academy my love of problem-solving is stronger than ever. Above all, I value creativity and working communities that foster collaboration and growth.

> An interesting tidbit...

I produce a bi-monthly podcast called Story Tadpole. It’s not your run of the mill cast, and that’s because it’s better :) Story Tadpole is a collection of offbeat tales, poems, and interviews written and narrated by yours truly. I tell all my friend(s) to listen, but only some of them do. I tell those who don’t listen that they’re missing out, but who am I to dictate what their ears should hear, and really, who are they to dictate what their ears should hear. Ears should be able to decide for themselves what they hear and what they don’t! Alas, such questions can only be answered through listening to Story Tadpole.

It feels amazing to be able to give life to some of my stranger thoughts. However, the real beauty of Story Tadpole has been its ability to spark unconventional conversations with my friends, family, and my community of listeners. If you have any ideas for a cool episode, tell me in the five-star review you’re going to leave on iTunes, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app...just kidding, you don’t have to leave a review, but there are some links at the bottom if you want to listen! -->
