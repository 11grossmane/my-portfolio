> Before I tell you about myself, here's quick fun fact, because the more you know... The unicorn is the national animal of Scotland, seriously, it is.

Hi, I'm Eric Grossman. I am a passionate, and hardworking developer looking for a team of like-minded individuals. For the past few years, I have taught science at an outdoor school in Santa, Cruz California. My favorite part of the job was discovering new ways to deal with the challenge of an unpredictable setting. For this reason, I began searching for a career that would provide these kinds of challenges on a regular basis. My journey led me to begin exploring the world of coding, and before long I fell in love with the way it allowed me to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller parts. After graduating from Fullstack Academy my love of problem-solving is stronger than ever. Above all, I value creativity and working communities that foster collaboration and growth.
